# What is Veams?

__Veams is one of the most flexible and efficient system to build scalable Web Apps, HTML5 web interfaces and Prototypes. It is extremely extensible and efficiently architected.__

Veams contains various (pluggable) instruments which are controlled by our custom command line interface.

## Veams Toolkit

`VEAMS` provides a variety of tools to support and simplify your life as a developer. 

1. It has a CLI to setup projects, components, services and more.
1. It exposes a Framework which you can use in static-page and single-page apps.
1. You have a frontend methodology on hand.
1. You can install configurable `VEAMS` components with a documentation out of the box.

### Our CLI (@veams/cli)

The CLI is a command line interface for scaffolds and build processes.
The key benefit is the rapid setup time. You can easily create complex application setups with @veams/cli in a few minutes.


## Framework

Veams exposes a framework (`@veams/core`) which you can use as a simple starting point. This starting point can be enhanced and extended by an easy plugin system.

The purpose of Veams is to individually build up a __project based framework__ in a simple, fast, scalable and understandable way.

It is not opinionated, means use the stack which fits best to your project, for example Backbone, React, Foundation or something else.

### Methodology

Veams-Methodology is a system for your whole frontend stack. Typical questions - which Veams-Methodology is solving - are:

1. How to scope and differentiate units (Components, Utilities, Regions) in your HTML?
2. How to bind JavaScript to your DOM elements?
3. How to structure layouts?
4. How to write your classes?
5. How to extend your project?

### Components

Veams provides a building blocks library to speed up templating in projects.

All components can be found here: https://github.com/Veams
