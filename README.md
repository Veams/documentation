## Veams Toolkit

`VEAMS` provides a variety of tools to support and simplify your life as a developer. 

1. It has a CLI to setup projects, components, services and more.
1. It exposes a framework that you can use to build static-page and single-page apps.
1. It provides a frontend methodology to guide your development.
1. You can install configurable `VEAMS` components that are well-documented and work out of the box.

[//]: # ({{/wrapWith}})
[//]: # ({{#wrapWith "content-section"}})

[//]: # ({{#wrapWith "grid-row"}})
[//]: #     ({{#wrapWith "grid-col" colClasses="is-col-mobile-l-8"}})

### Our CLI (@veams/cli)

VEAMS CLI is a command line interface for scaffolding and build processes.
The key benefit is the rapid setup time. With @veams/cli, you can easily generate complex application setups in a few minutes.

[//]: #     ({{/wrapWith}})
[//]: # ({{/wrapWith}})

[//]: # ({{/wrapWith}})
[//]: # ({{#wrapWith "content-section"}})

[//]: # ({{#wrapWith "grid-row"}})
[//]: #     ({{#wrapWith "grid-col" colClasses="is-col-mobile-l-8"}})

## Framework

Veams exposes a framework (`@veams/core`) which you can use as a simple starting point. This starting point can be enhanced and extended by an easy to use plugin system.

The purpose of Veams is to individually build up a __project based framework__ in a simple, fast, scalable and easily understandable way.

It is not opinionated, which means you can use the stack which best fits your project, for example Backbone, React, Foundation or something else.

### Typical Use Cases

#### Static Page Application

Veams is used in many projects in the agency I work for.

The majority of projects are portal like websites, they are mostly static (CMS) and get enhanced with (a lot of) JavaScript.

That's why all plugins or components are heavily optimised for that project type.

#### Single Page Application

Veams can also be used in SPA projects. With the new CLI you can scaffold React projects as well. There are a few blueprints which can be easily used to scaffold components.

Just take a look at: 
- [React Container Blueprint](https://github.com/Veams/bp-react-container)
- [Redux Blueprint](https://github.com/Veams/bp-redux)

[//]: # ({{/wrapWith}})
[//]: # ({{#wrapWith "content-section"}})

[//]: # ({{#wrapWith "grid-row"}})
[//]: #     ({{#wrapWith "grid-col" colClasses="is-col-mobile-l-8"}})

### Methodology

Veams-Methodology is a complete development system for your frontend stack. Typical questions - which Veams-Methodology is answering - are:

1. How to scope and differentiate units (Components, Utilities, Regions) in your HTML?
2. How to bind JavaScript to your DOM elements?
3. How to structure layouts?
4. How to write your classes?
5. How to extend your project?

[//]: #     ({{/wrapWith}})
[//]: # ({{/wrapWith}})

[//]: # ({{/wrapWith}})
[//]: # ({{#wrapWith "content-section"}})

[//]: # ({{#wrapWith "grid-row"}})
[//]: #     ({{#wrapWith "grid-col" colClasses="is-col-mobile-l-8"}})

### Components

Veams provides a building blocks library to speed up templating.

All components can be found here: https://github.com/Veams
