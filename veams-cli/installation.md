### Installation of NodeJS

Just install [NodeJS from their website](http://nodejs.org) and be sure it is in your environment path. You can check it in your console:

``` bash
node -v
```

### Installation of VEAMS
Now install our pretty neat `VEAMS` CLI:

``` bash
npm install -g @veams/cli
```

If you want to update `VEAMS` you can do the following:

``` bash
veams update
```

Now we have installed all important tools to work with the standard features of Veams.
