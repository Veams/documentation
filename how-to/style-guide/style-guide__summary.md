# Veams Documenatation Style Guide
---

## Introduction

This style guide is a reference for writing consistent documentation that is easy to understand.

Instead of creating style guide from scratch, this style guide heavily borrows from Google's Developer Documentation Style Guide.

This documentation is a living guide, which means it will be reviewed regularly and changes will be when it makes sense.

This introduction is summary of the key points regarding how we maintain consistency and clarity with our documentation.

### Tone and Content
- Be conversational and friendly without being humorous.
- Don't pre-announce anything in documentation.
- Use descriptive link text.
- Write accessibly.
- Write for a global audience.

### Language and Grammar
- Use second person: "you" rather than "we."
- Use active voice; make clear who's performing the action.
- Use standard American spelling and punctuation.
- Put conditional clauses before instructions, not after.
- For usage and spelling of specific words, see the word list.

### Formatting, Punctuation, and Organization
- Use sentence case for document titles and section headings.
- Use numbered lists for sequences.
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential lists.
- Use description lists for pairs of related pieces of data.
- Use serial commas.
- Put code-related text in code blocks.
- Put UI elements in bold.
- Use unambiguous date formatting.

### Images
- Use SVG files or crushed PNG images.
- Provide alt text.
- Provide high-resolution images when practical.

**Each bullet point should have a link with examples of good vs. bad styles
